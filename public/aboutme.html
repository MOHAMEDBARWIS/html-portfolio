<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm A. Mohamed barwis. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a commendable CGPA of 8.37 from Velammal College of Engineering and Technology. Prior to that, I completed my secondary schooling at Fuscos Matriculation Higher Secondary School and my higher secondary education at Saracens Matriculation, both with first-class distinction.</p>

<p>During my academic journey, I actively engaged in various projects and competitions, showcasing my technical skills and passion for innovation. One of my notable projects was the development of a plant moisture monitoring system using Arduino, demonstrating my ability to apply technology for practical solutions. Additionally, I worked on an Automatic Number Plate Recognition system in high-speed and heavy traffic using MATLAB as part of a team. This project, aimed at Traffic Light Negotiation and Perception-Based Detection, was shortlisted for the prestigious SIH 2022 competition</p>

<p>To further expand my knowledge and gain practical experience, I undertook internships in the field of Data Science & Business Analytics at SPARKS FOUNDATION and Python for AI at ELITE TECHNO GROUPS. These experiences allowed me to apply my technical skills in real-world scenarios and enhanced my understanding of data analysis and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Recognizing the importance of continuous learning and staying updated with the latest advancements, I actively participate in technical events and competitions. I am proud to have won the 3rd prize in Techutsav-2020, organized by Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Madurai, and the 2nd prize in SCINSEA 2K21, conducted by Kongu College of Engineering, Erode.</p>

<p>I am a dedicated and enthusiastic individual with a strong academic background in Electronics and Communication Engineering. My experiences in project development, internships, and competitions have shaped me into a versatile professional, equipped with skills in data science, artificial intelligence, and problem-solving. I am passionate about leveraging technology to drive innovation and contribute to the ever-evolving field of engineering and technology."</p>
